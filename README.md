# Turn Off Location

Quick Access: [TurnOffLocation.com](https://turnofflocation.com)

> A privacy-focused tutorial site that helps users turn off location tracking on social platforms like Instagram — starting with clear, step-by-step guides featuring images and explanations.

## 📌 Project Background

On August 6, 2025, Instagram quietly rolled out a new feature — **Instagram Map** — in the U.S. and other regions. This feature allows users to actively share their recent activity locations and view content from nearby users on a map.

Although Instagram claims the feature is “off by default” and only visible to mutual followers or selected users, it quickly sparked **widespread privacy concerns** across social media platforms. Users on TikTok, Threads, X (formerly Twitter), and others began to question:

* Is it really “off by default”?
* Has my location been exposed without my knowledge?
* Could this feature be used for **stalking, harassment, or location-based attacks**?

Searches for “how to turn off Instagram location” surged, reflecting growing anxiety around digital privacy — and a strong demand for clear instructions.

## 💡 About This Project

[turnofflocation.com](https://turnofflocation.com) was created in direct response to this situation.

Our mission is to provide privacy-conscious users with a **clear, fast, and ad-free** instructional website — solving what seems like a simple but often frustrating problem:

> “How do I actually turn off Instagram’s location tracking?”

In reality, the option is often buried deep in multiple menus, with vague guidance from the platform. Users typically have to consult multiple sources before finding a reliable solution.

**This project aims to simplify that experience** —  
with straightforward visual tutorials that help everyone **take control of their privacy.**

## 🎯 Our Goals

* Deliver **accurate, authoritative, and frequently updated** privacy-setting guides  
* Provide tailored instructions for **iOS, Android, and desktop platforms**  
* Help users understand the true implications of each privacy setting  
* Offer a clean, distraction-free interface to **lower the barrier to privacy protection**
