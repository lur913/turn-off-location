Welcome to [TurnOffLocation.com](https://turnofflocation.com/) (the "Website"). These Terms of Use (the "Terms") are the mutual agreements that apply when we provide our services to you.

By visiting or using the Website, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to follow these Terms. If you do not agree, please stop using the Website immediately.

## 1. Service Description

The Website is a privacy-focused tutorial site that provides step-by-step guides and video walkthroughs for turning off location tracking in social apps (currently focusing on Instagram). Some content is embedded via `iframe` from third parties (e.g., YouTube). The Website does not host third-party video content and primarily serves as an informational and educational entry point. All services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

## 2. Original Content and Rights

- **Our Content**: Rights related to the Website’s interface design, text, graphics, logos, screenshots (excluding third-party marks/logos), and content organization belong to us or the respective rights holders. Do not copy, distribute, adapt, or use such content for other purposes without our explicit written permission.

- **Third-Party Content and Trademarks**: Third-party content appearing on the Website (including but not limited to Instagram, its trademarks/logos, YouTube videos, and screenshots) belongs to their respective owners. The Website is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by those third parties. When using third-party content, you must comply with the relevant providers’ rules and policies.

## 3. User Conduct

When using the Website, you agree not to do any of the following:

- Engage in any illegal, misleading, or fraudulent activities.
- Attempt to interfere with the normal operation of our servers or networks.
- Use robots, crawlers, or other automated tools to access or scrape content from the Website.
- Probe or reverse-engineer the technical implementation of the Website.
- Bypass or attempt to bypass any security measures we deploy to protect the Website.

## 4. Third-Party Links and Content

The Website contains links and embedded content from third-party sites and services (e.g., YouTube). We do not control those third parties and are not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or actions. Your use of, or reliance on, any third-party content is at your own risk.

## 5. Accuracy of Information and No Legal Advice

We strive to provide accurate and timely tutorial information, but social platforms (such as Instagram) may change interfaces and settings with new versions. We do not guarantee completeness, timeliness, or suitability of the information, and nothing on the Website constitutes legal, compliance, or professional advice. You should independently evaluate your situation and assume the associated risks.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Website and its maintainers/contributors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of your use of (or inability to use) the Website, reliance on information provided, or interactions with third parties.

## 7. Advertising and Consent Management

To support sustainable operations, we may integrate third-party advertising in the future (e.g., Google AdSense/Ad Manager). If enabled, relevant third parties may process data for ad serving, frequency capping, measurement, and anti-abuse, and—where you consent—personalized ads. We will comply with applicable laws and platform policies, obtain and record your choices via a consent management tool, and allow you to change or withdraw consent at any time.

For details, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

## 8. Updates to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and reflected in the “Last Updated” date above. If you continue using the Website after updates are posted, you agree to the new Terms.

## 9. Disputes and Questions

We aim to provide a good experience. If you have questions or disputes regarding these Terms or our services, please contact us first—we are happy to communicate and seek an amicable resolution.

These Terms will be interpreted and applied in a fair and reasonable manner, with reference to general industry practices and applicable law.
