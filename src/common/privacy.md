These tools may use technologies like cookies to collect your non-personal information, such as pages visited, time spent, and browser type, to generate aggregated statistical reports.

- **Advertising Services**: We may partner with third-party advertising networks in the future to display advertisements on the Website. These ad partners may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies to collect information about you to display more relevant ads based on your interests and online behavior.

These third-party services follow their own privacy policies when collecting and using information.
