Welcome to TurnOffLocation.com ("the Website"). We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you visit and use our services.

Please read this policy carefully before using the Website.

## 1. We Do Not Collect Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

The core function of this Website is to provide step-by-step tutorials on how to turn off location tracking in social apps. We do not require account registration and we do not actively collect your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) via forms or Cookies (e.g., name, email address, phone number, or physical address).

## 2. Types of Information We Process

Although we do not collect PII, certain non-personal information may be automatically processed when you interact with the Website:

- **Server logs and device information**: Like most websites, hosting providers may log standard technical information sent by your browser such as IP address, browser type and version, access time, and referring URLs. We use this information only for security, abuse prevention, and aggregated statistics, not to identify you personally.
- **Embedded media interaction data**: We embed third-party videos (e.g., YouTube tutorials) via `iframe`. When you watch or interact with embedded content, those third parties may process usage data (e.g., IP, viewing behavior, device information) under their own policies. We use `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"` to reduce unnecessary referrer leakage.

## 3. Cookies and Local Storage

- **Website settings**: We do not use Cookies to track individuals. We currently do not use third-party tracking pixels (e.g., ad pixels, remarketing pixels) and do not store personally identifying data in local storage. If we integrate advertising in the future (e.g., Google AdSense/Ad Manager) to support sustainable operations, third parties may set Cookies or local storage identifiers for ad serving, frequency capping, measurement, and anti-abuse. We will obtain your consent via a consent management tool and provide an option to withdraw consent at any time.
- **Third-party embeds**: YouTube and other third parties may set Cookies or use local storage in their players for playback and anti-abuse. You can restrict third-party Cookies in your browser settings or use tracking protection tools.

## 4. Third-Party Services and Data Processing

To operate and improve the Website, we may integrate third-party services with independent privacy policies and practices that we do not control. These include:

- **Embedded content**: Third-party videos such as YouTube. When you interact with this content, third parties may collect and process your usage data under their policies.
- **Hosting and delivery**: Hosting providers and CDNs may process access logs for security and operational purposes.

These third parties collect and use information under their own privacy policies. Please review their policies for details. We are not responsible for the data processing practices of any third-party websites or services.

## 5. Advertising and Tracking

- **Current status**: The Website does not currently serve ads and does not share user data with third-party ad networks.
- **Future plan**: To support sustainable operations, we may integrate Google advertising products (e.g., Google AdSense or Google Ad Manager) in the future.
- **Data use and technologies**: If ads are integrated, Google and its partners may use Cookies/local storage and online identifiers for ad serving, frequency capping, measurement, anti-abuse, and—where you consent—personalized advertising. You can change your choices at any time in the consent tool and may opt to receive Non-Personalized Ads (NPA) only.
- **Compliance and consent**: We will comply with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA/CPRA) and Google's [EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/), displaying consent prompts where required and recording your choices.
- **Controls and opt-out**:

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect Website security and availability. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page; the "Last Updated" date at the top reflects the effective date of the latest version. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for updates.
